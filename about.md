Hi! I'm Grant. I'm originally from the midwestern town of St. Charles, Illinois. I studied economics and philosophy at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and got my start in programming doing basic Ruby on Rails and JavaScript/React web apps.
Currently I'm a robotic process automation developer for a consulting firm called Ashling Partners working mostly with UiPath on the University of Notre Dame account.
