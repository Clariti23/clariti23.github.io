Hi! I'm Grant. I'm originally from St. Charles, Illinois. I studied economics and philosophy at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and got my start in programming building web apps.

In my day job I'm a robotic process automation developer for a consulting firm called Ashling Partners working mostly with VB.Net/C# on the University of Notre Dame account.
